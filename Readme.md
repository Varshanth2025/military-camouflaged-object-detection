Camofledge: Camouflage Detection Web App

A full-stack AI application built with Flask, OpenCV, and YOLOv5/YOLOv8. Camofledge enables users to upload images and detect camouflaged objects (people, weapons, vehicles, suspects) using multiple state-of-the-art pre-trained models. The platform is designed for rapid prototyping, easy deployment, and a responsive user experience.

🎯 Performance Highlights
Full-Stack AI Integration: Combines a Flask web frontend with backend model inference for seamless user interaction.
Pre-trained Model Deployment: Uses YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 models for fast, accurate detection—no need for retraining.
Image Upload & Visualization: Handles user image uploads and displays detection results with bounding boxes.
Rapid Prototyping: Ideal for demonstrating real-world AI applications without lengthy training cycles.
